This project uses data from the Minecraft research server collected by the University of British Columbia Computer Science department, especifically, players.csv which contains general information about the players in the server. This data is used to create a linnear regression to player characteristics such as age, gender, experience level, and subscription status to predict how many hours a player will spend on the server.
